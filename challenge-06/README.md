# Binar-FullStack Web Development 1

Hello welcome to my repo,This repository about Challenge in Binar Academy. this repo is about chapter challenge 6, which is we should create a website using React/Next.js. this is an opportunity for me to learn skills more deeply, that's why I use some of the stacks below/

## TechStack so far

- [`Next js`](https://nextjs.org/)

  > Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.

- [`Tailwind CSS`](https://tailwindcss.com/)

  > Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.

- [`Swiper js`](https://swiperjs.com/)

  > Swiper is the most modern free and open source mobile touch slider with hardware accelerated transitions and amazing native behavior. Use it on websites, web apps, and mobile native/hybrid apps.

- [`Shadcn ui`](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

  > Re-usable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. This is NOT a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

## Tools

- [`vsCode (Code Editor)`](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

  > Visual Studio Code is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications.

- [`GIT (Version Control)`](https://git-scm.com/)

  > Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

- [`Typescript (TSX)`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html)

  > TypeScript ships with three JSX modes: preserve, react, and react-native. These modes only affect the emit stage - type checking is unaffected. The preserve mode will keep the JSX as part of the output to be further consumed by another transform step (e.g. Babel).

## Getting Started

```
1. npm i
2. npm run dev
3. Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
4. if the button cannot click/active, refresh page and wait next js to compiling.
```
